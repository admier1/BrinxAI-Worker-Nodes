# BrinxAI Worker Nodes Setup

Worker Nodes are the operational units of the BrinxAI network, executing the tasks distributed by Central Nodes. They are crucial for the functionality of the network, handling various AI operations such as image and video generation, text transformation, audio processing, website creation, code generation, and more.

Worker Nodes serve the following key purposes:

Task Execution: They perform the actual computational tasks assigned by Central Nodes.

Resource Utilization: Utilize their hardware resources to process tasks efficiently.

Feedback Loop: Provide performance feedback to Central Nodes to help optimize task distribution.

How Worker Nodes Work? 

Task Reception
Task Assignment: Worker Nodes receive tasks from Central Nodes based on their current capacity and load.

Task Acknowledgement: Once a task is received, the Worker Node acknowledges receipt and begins processing.

Task Execution
Resource Allocation: The Worker Node allocates the necessary resources (CPU, memory, storage) to the task.

Processing: Executes the task using the AI models and algorithms provided by BrinxAI.

Progress Tracking: Continuously monitors the progress of the task, ensuring it stays within operational parameters.

Task Completion
Result Generation: Upon completion, the Worker Node generates the output of the task (e.g., processed image, translated text).

Result Transmission: Sends the results back to the Central Node or directly to the user, depending on the task requirements.

Status Update: Updates its status and resource availability to the Central Node, enabling real-time load balancing.

## System Requirements for Worker Nodes
